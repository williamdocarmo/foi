    "correctAnswer": "Zeugma uses one verb to govern multiple nouns or phrases, creating a comedic effect; however, it can be unclear if the verb doesn't logically apply to all elements. Example: 'She broke his heart and a vase'.",
    "explanation": "Zeugma's humor comes from the unexpected connection between disparate nouns linked by a single verb.  However, if the connection is too tenuous, it can lead to confusion.  The example 'She broke his heart and a vase' works because the act of breaking applies to both, albeit metaphorically in one case.  The pitfall lies in pushing the limits of the verb's applicability.  An example of poor use would be: 'He opened the door and a new chapter in his life'. The opening of a new chapter isn't really an 'opening' in the same sense as the door.  This highlights the stylistic tightrope walk of effectively using zeugma.  Curiously, zeugma's effectiveness can be subjective, depending on the reader's interpretation and humor.",

    "explanation": "A caesura is a pause or break within a line of poetry, often indicated by punctuation. This break disrupts the regular rhythm and creates a dramatic effect. For example:  'The sun| descends| slowly, casting long shadows.' The break after 'sun' creates a noticeable pause, altering the rhythm.

    "explanation": "Catachresis involves using a word in an unexpected way, often due to a lack of a more precise word.  This can be incredibly creative but can also be confusing or nonsensical.  For example:  'The sun's rays fingered the sleeping town,' uses 'fingered' creatively, but might be confusing if 'touched' or 'illuminated' would be clearer. The inherent risk lies in the potential for misinterpretation.  Interestingly, many successful catachreses become accepted as standard usage over time!",
